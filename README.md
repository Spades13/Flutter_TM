# Flutter_TM
School TM project for revision app


# How it works?
The app helps students organize their work flow, and maximize efficiency. We collect data on how they study, and when they are distracted by their phone, to present the data at a later time, so that the student knows when he is efficient and when he is not.

# What method?
We decided to use the POMODORO technique, because we believe it is one of the best ways to learn to focus and study for a long time.
It uses short study sessions(about 1h long) and short break intervals(about 10 min) so that the student never feels too tired, and can go for longer total study times
