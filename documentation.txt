minutsbreak->scroll wheel setup
hoursstudy->scroll wheel setup
hoursbreak->scroll wheel setup
homepage->page contains main background color and also bottom app bar/nav bar
tracking->different page of app, contains the countdown timer and quit button

Functionalities:
timer-> global var for user input(through scroll wheel), which is called back in tracking,
which is the countdown page. we also use this global var to forbid the button from working 
when study min or hour = 0

setTheme() --> checks if local storage for variable "variable" is true or false, and sets
theme accordingly








Todo:
<<<<<<< HEAD
make timer stop after study, wait a few seconds and do beeping noise, then move on to
break time, then wait again and do beeping noise, and start new study session(looped until
quit button is pressed)
Make quit button have a "are you sure you want to quit?" popup
Add rain sounds that can be selected in settings
Add bg according to theme
Add text on userhomepage that says which is minutes and hours
Add text on tracking.dart that says if "Break" or "Study"
Add "i" button to explain functionality of certain fetures
START WORKING ON DATABASE TO STORE USER STUDY DATA(SQL OR FLASK)
=======

Bug_list:
-when you change timer from 0 and then navigate to another page(like settings), and return to the timer page, the time resets to 0 but if you press the start button,
it will be the time selected in the begining.
